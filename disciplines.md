## the many disciplines of hacking
hacking is an incredibly difficult term to define. the most accepted definitions typically describe the qualities of a hacker first, and imply the meaning of hacking as the acts in which a hacker typically enjoys engaging in. this is confusing. hacking is the creation of clever solutions to problems. hacking can also be defined as quality research, design, and development, rather than implementation. due to the looseness of these definitions, every field of technological development may be considered to fall under the definition of hacking, so long as the development is of good quality.
