## fundamental rules for a hacker order
author's comments

### 0.4 bad code, information, and ideas may be criticized, deconstructed, ridiculed, etc.
 - ridicule should be discouraged, but not restricted.
 - bad hackers must not be ridiculed.
	 - ridicule of bad hackers would violate rule [ref].
 - bad behaviors may be ridiculed ( cautiously ).
 - the good qualities of bad code, information, and ideas must be respected.

### 0.5 a hacker must not be forced to give up code, information, or ideas against their will.
 - this rule, in present society, is not absolutely practical. presently, many hackers must contribute code, information, and ideas to organizations through a legal process in which they lose attribution and ownership. they often submit themselves to this process in order to fund their subsistance. this process breaks rules:\[ ref, ref, ref\] and the practice should be abolished. in order to abolish the practice, all persons must be able to subsist without contributing. ideally, all persons should be able to subsist happily. ideally, this would be done through permanent technical means, but social means may be temporarily acceptable.

### 0.6 contribution of code, information, or ideas to the order must be attributed to the contribution's author(s), or nobody at all.
 - hackers may contribute anonymously ( with the understanding that they will not and can not be credited for the contribution, and that the contribution will not be trusted until audited by other members of the order ).
	 - this may be done with temporary identities. the anonymous hacker wishing to preserve their anonimity show be aware of how speech, writing, and other behaviors can reveal identities. for this reason, segregating one's identities may be useful.

### 0.7 all code, information, and ideas contributed to the order must be shared with all members of the order without restriction.
 - contributions should be made as accessible to all the members of the order, especially to those of lesser skill and knowledge, as is possible without reducing the quality of the contribution.
 - present society has many rules regarding the sharing of code, information, and ideas. when contributing to present society, one must explicitly state the terms of usage of the contribution. these terms often contain clauses that violate rules [ref]. in order to avoid conflicts with present society ( as long as the aforementioned rules are in effect ), contributions to the order should be acompanied by terms of usage that do not violate the rules of the order, nor present society. if this cannot be done, the rules of the society must be made compatible before the contribution can be accepted by the order.

### 0.a members of the order may share code, information, and ideas with others outside the order.
 - members of the order should be extremely careful when sharing with non-members. non-members should be expected to not respect any of the fundamental rules of the order. non-members who exhibit respect for the rules should perhaps be encouraged to join the order.

### 1.0 :: limit sharing, trading, and collaboration with organizations that violate the spirit of the order.
 - this rule can be difficult to implement, and exceedingly difficult or impossible to enforce. an order's best defense against violations of this rule is trust in its member's affinity with the order's spirit.
 - the intensity of this response can be scaled to the scale of the incompatibility.
