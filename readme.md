I have a vision of a different type of human society - a Hacker Order. These are my thoughts on how such an organization might be created and how it should function. When I believe the time is ripe, I will use this to found the Koutetsukai Hacker Order. I also hope to inspire the creation of orders accros the globe - so feel free to use this work as a reference in founding your own.

Humans nowadays are somewhat stuck on the idea that every member of society must work, and should work as hard as possible. This prevalent belief, coupled with the advent of computing and freedom of information, is leading us to a collapse. 

Humans and computers are engaged in a sort of arms race. This is not a bad thing - computers enabling huge progressions in quality of life for many humans, but they are simultaneously destroying entire industries full of human workers. Especially with the coming advent of artificial intelligence, there is truely no domain of human work safe from the onslaught of automation.

The non-hostile takeover of work by machines will not affect all people immediately nor equally. The first to lose out will be the less-able, either in terms of difficulty or quantity of work. A gradual transition will then take place. More and more, humans will find themselves programming their work instead of doing it themselves. This will create an ever-rising skill cap in both programming ability, and understanding of the fields of human interest. I am personally fortunate that, due to my programming ability, I am likely to remain in the latter category for some time. Still I dread the day that my skills too are eclipsed by that of computers, presumably via AI.

And so, hopefully not too late, I'm attempting to create a new human society. The long term goal of this project is to form a society where no individual is forced to work, but where contribution is both supported and rewarded. The details of how this will be accomplished are contained herewithin.
